/**
 * D-068 (COWORK.md) — dual-write phase. `OrderTimeBooking` rows are written
 * alongside the existing ServiceOrder scalar fields (scheduledAt/startedAt/
 * expectedFinishAt/occupiesCapacity), which remain the only thing any read
 * path actually consults for now. These helpers are the single place that
 * decides how a status/capacity change maps to booking rows, so the order
 * actions in app/_actions/orders.ts never hand-roll this logic individually.
 *
 * Invariant (D-076): an order may have at most one OPEN (closedAt: null)
 * ACTIVE booking (what it occupies right now) AND, independently, at most one
 * open SCHEDULED booking (a follow-up reserved for later — a POSTPONED
 * return time, or a next-visit booked while still IN_PROGRESS) — never two of
 * the same kind at once, but one of each MAY coexist. Every helper below that
 * touches "the open booking" therefore takes an explicit `kind` argument
 * (or, for closeOpenOrderTimeBooking, an explicit "all") — there is no safe
 * kind-agnostic default once two rows can be open simultaneously.

/**
 * S06 fix (WEB_SCHEDULING_ASSESSMENT_2026-09-10.md): staff order mutations
 * used to validate against an unlocked `findFirst` read, then write inside a
 * separate lock-free `prisma.$transaction` — two concurrent operations on the
 * same order (two staff members, or staff + a cron job) could both pass
 * validation against the same stale snapshot and then both write (e.g. an
 * expiry job cancelling a row a human just moved, or two concurrent
 * "postpone" calls each seeing "no open SCHEDULED row" and both inserting
 * one).
 *
 * This mirrors the proven lock pattern in lib/appointment-reservations.ts
 * (`reserveAppointmentInTransaction`/`moveAppointmentInTransaction`): take a
 * row lock on the `ServiceOrder` itself via `FOR UPDATE` inside
 * `withBookingTransaction`, THEN re-read the order fresh under that lock, and
 * hand both the fresh row and the transaction client to `work` — which must
 * do its own validation against the fresh row (not any earlier, pre-lock
 * read) before writing. `work` receives `order: null` when the row doesn't
 * exist (or isn't visible under RLS) so callers can return their usual
 * "not found" response instead of the wrapper throwing on their behalf.
 *
 * `order` is handed to `work` untyped (`unknown`) rather than derived from
 * `select` via `Prisma.ServiceOrderGetPayload` — combining that with the
 * already-heavy `PrismaTransactionClient` (itself derived from the
 * RLS-extended client) blows out the type checker ("Excessive stack depth
 * comparing types"). Callers cast the row to the shape their own `select`
 * produces at the top of their callback instead.
