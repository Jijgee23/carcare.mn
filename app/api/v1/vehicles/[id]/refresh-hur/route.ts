// POST /api/v1/vehicles/[id]/refresh-hur — first staff-side HUR refresh
// (P3-B4). `lib/vehicle-hur-refresh.ts` is reused unchanged; its doc comment
// states ownership checking is the caller's responsibility. The account/
// mobile route (`app/api/v1/app/vehicles/[id]/refresh-hur/route.ts`) proves
// ownership via an AccountVehicle link scoped to the caller's account. This
// route proves it the tenant-staff way: a TenantVehicle link scoped to the
// caller's tenantId. `id` is the Vehicle id (see the sibling
// `app/api/v1/vehicles/[id]/route.ts` for why, and the 404-not-403 rule that
// applies identically here).
//
// KNOWN CROSS-TENANT LEAK (flagged, not fixed here — out of this route's
// owned scope and `refreshVehicleFieldsFromHur` is explicitly not to be
// forked/modified by this slice): `refreshVehicleFieldsFromHur` returns
// `serviceCount`/`diagnosisCount` counted with an UNSCOPED Prisma `_count`
// (`serviceOrders`/`diagnosticReports` on the global Vehicle row, across ALL
// tenants that share it). Returning those numbers verbatim to a tenant client
// would disclose how much work other tenants have done on this vehicle. This
// route deliberately DROPS both fields from its response rather than
// replacing them with a tenant-scoped recount, because no caller here needs
// them (the record refresh only updates make/model/year/vin/fuelType/
// wheelPosition/colorName/capacity/purpose) and adding two extra scoped
// count queries just to discard the result would be needless work. The
// existing account/mobile route
// (`app/api/v1/app/vehicles/[id]/refresh-hur/route.ts`) passes these same
// counts through, and that is NOT the same problem: its caller owns the
// registration, so "this car's history across the shops it visited" is their
// own data. The distinction is the caller, not the number — so do not
// "fix" the account route by analogy with this one.
